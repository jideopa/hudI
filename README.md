# hudI
This is a BDD framework. I've used Cucumber and Gherkin to design and prioritise the test cases. Selenium Webdriver is used to interact with the web element.

Java programming language for the back-end logic

I've used the Page Object Model design pattern for managing the web element locators and Maven build tool to manage dependencies.

Junit is used to run the project.

For test validation, Junit assertions are used.

For the automation report, I have a cucumber report.

The Lombok project library is used for managing logs and class Getters and Setters.

Test can be run using HudIRunner.class
